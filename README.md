<h3 align="center">Digital Future's Rock, Paper, Scissors Challenge!</h3>

  <p align="center">

  This was my fifth challenge as part of the Digital Future's academy, and it was a back-end Node.JS challenge. The task is to provide a backend server that runs Rock, Paper, Scissors games that can be played on the web and fulfills the user stories.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
### Acceptance Criteria
```
As a DFAT member
So that I can see my name

I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

### Extended Acceptance Criteria

### Project Plan

#### User Story 1
```
As a DFAT member
So that I can see my name
I would like to register my name before playing an online game
```

#### User Story 2
```
As a DFAT member
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

#### Tests
Player:
1. Test that a player is created with a name. 
2. Test that a player has a null weapon when made. 
3. Test that a weapon is assigned when chosen.

I decided to implement the two player option early, so that this would need less refactoring when I came to tackle the extended criteria. The aim was to set two players (always) and then have an option to play against a computer, or another player. 

#### Domain Model

| Objects      | Properties         | Messages                        | Output  |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------- |
| Player       | name               | weaponChoice(choice)            |         |
|              | weapon             |                                 |         |
|              |                    |                                 |         |
| RPS          | weaponBank         |                                 |         |
|              | player1            |                                 |         |
|              | player2            |                                 |         |
|              | winner             | getWinner()                     | @string |
|              |                    | result()                        | @string |
| Computer     | computerWeaponBank | computerWeapon()                | @string |
|              |                    |                                 |         |
|              |                    |                                 |         |
| RPSOnePlayer | newPlayer          | playerConstructor(name, weapon) | @Player |
|              | computerChoice     | computerFight()                 | @String |
|              | outcome            | gameOutcome()                   | @string |

#### Tests
1. Should create a player with the correct name
2. getWinner() should return a string.
3. Should return the correct string, depending who wins the game. 

With the two main classes set up, I then began to do the routing for the application. I began with app.js to set up the server. I am going to test that the request has succeeded by looking for HTTP 200 (OK status). 

#### Tests
1. Test that app renders the server.
2. The app should render the title. 
3. It should have a /game route. 
4. The /game page should render "Choose your weapon"
5. It should have a /winner route. 
6. The /winner page should render "And the winner is..."

#### Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard

Use the _special_ rules ( _you can find them here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock_ )

To implement these rules into my game, I needed to refactor the code to add two more options into my weaponBank, and return the correct result when each is played. 

#### Multiplayer

I built my game to have a multiplayer option first. Now, I need to implement a one player option. The first thing that I did was create a landing page, with a link to either the one player or two player options. Now, I need to create the components for the one player game. I then created a separate index page for the one player game, which involved only one name submission box.

I struggled to implement the same code for the single-player version of the game. I decided to use a different method for the gameOutcome() method. With more time, I would like to refactor this so that it uses the same functionality and is shorter.  

#### Tests
1. A game should have a player with the correct name. 
2. The computer method should choose a valid weapon.
3. The computer method should generate an array of weapons.

## Project Review

- [ ] The extended criteria have been met by the application as the multiplayer feature has been implemented with 5 options for weapon. The result of the game is displayed on the last page. 
- [ ] The logic of the game is not working properly, there are only two possible results: draw or player 2 wins. 
- [ ] There is good test coverage that checks the game logic, routes and rendered views. 
- [ ] As good practice, to keep the code clean, I should remove any commented code left behind before submitting the project.
